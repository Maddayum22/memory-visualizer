# memory-visualizer
Rust project for a memory visualizer, in progress.

Right now this program runs in console. It takes a file path as input, and returns some information.
The idea for this is that it will get an interface where you input code files and you get to see all kinds of statistics about your code.
Information like:
- Memory usage
- Amount of variables, functions etc.
- to be decided...

# setup
``` cargo build; cargo run```
